# Jackson's Personal Website

A portfolio site built to showcase my work, share my interests, and connect with others in the tech community.

## About the Site

Hi, Iâ€™m **Jackson** â€” a passionate software engineer and recent graduate from the University of Pennsylvania's MCIT program. With a background in computer science, AI, and machine learning, I specialize in automating image processing and training AI models.

This website serves as my personal hub. Here, you'll find:
- A curated portfolio of my AI and software projects
- Highlights from my professional experience
- A look into some of my interests outside of work, like backpacking and astronomy

I created this site to tell my story and document my journey as I continue to grow in the tech world.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 (Ubuntu), Gunicorn, Nginx
- **Other Tools**: SQLite, Git, GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Features

- Dynamic project and experience pages powered by Django models
- Responsive layout with clean, minimalist styling
- Easy-to-update architecture for ongoing content additions
- Secure deployment pipeline via AWS EC2

## Why I Built This

I wanted a space to present my work in a structured, thoughtful way while also learning more about full-stack deployment. Building and deploying this site helped reinforce key backend concepts, deployment strategies, and gave me full control over the stack â€” from code to production.

## Future Improvements

- Continuous improvement of CSS to enhance mobile user experience
